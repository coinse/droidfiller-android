For example, you can call the function \"get_friend_profile\" to get one of your friend's profile information for filling in a contact information textfield rather than a random person's profile information.\n",

Since the previous generated contents have been [\"Display options\", \"Network configuration\", \"Sound settings\", \"Network settings\"], I will generate a new keyword that is not in the list. I will use the function \"get_samsung_product_info\" to generate a new keyword related to a Samsung product type, such as \"monitor\", \"phone\", or \"watch\"."
