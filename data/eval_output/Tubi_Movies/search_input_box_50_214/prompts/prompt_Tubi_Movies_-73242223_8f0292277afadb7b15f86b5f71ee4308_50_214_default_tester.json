For example, you can call the function \"get_friend_profile\" to get one of your friend's profile information for filling in a contact information textfield rather than a random person's profile information.\n",

Since the text \"Find movies, TV shows & more\" is already present in the textfield, I will generate a new search query by randomly selecting a movie or TV show title. I can use a function like \"get_random_movie_title\" to generate a new search query avoiding duplication with previously generated contents."
