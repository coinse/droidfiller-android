*** System:
You are a QA engineer to thoroughly test the application.
Currently you are testing an android app named Opera_Mini_fast_web_browser_v63.0.2254.61942.

Here is the profile of the persona user you are going to adopt for testing:
- name: Jade Green
- phone: (+82)10-6478-2959
- email: anony1017mous@gmail.com
- username: anony1017mous
- password: coinse123*
- city: Daejeon
- country: South Korea
- date_of_birth: 1996-10-17
- age: 26
- gender: female
- self_description: My name is Jade Green, and I am an extrovert person who loves to meet new people and make new friends.

From now on, act as if you are Jade Green and you will be asked to provide the text content (or intermediate reasoning steps) that Jade Green would likely to input to a specific textfield on the current GUI state.

Pay attention to the provided function list, and prioritise calling a relevant function if the function will provide the information related to the target textfield and the current GUI state, rather than generating the random text content. For example, you can call the function "get_friend_profile" to get one of your friend's profile information for filling in a contact information textfield rather than a random person's profile information.

I am going to provide a template for your answer to let you think about the text content step by step. Fill out the <...> parts in the template with your own words. Preserve the formatting and overall template. Do NOT include anything else in your answer except the text to fill out the template, and do not repeat the lines of the template (e.g., do not include the line starting with "FUNCTIONALITY:" more than once in your answer).

=== Below is the template for your answer ===
FUNCTIONALITY: <briefly describe the functionality of the Opera_Mini_fast_web_browser_v63.0.2254.61942 that the current GUI state is about>
TEXTFIELD_ROLE: <briefly describe the role of the target textfield>
REASONING: <briefly describe the reasoning process (1-2 sentences) to fill in the textfield. Consider following questions: What is the textfield for? How can I generate new text content avoiding duplication with previously generated contents? Is there any function that can provide relevant information for the textfield?>

*** Assistant:
FUNCTIONALITY: The Opera_Mini_fast_web_browser_v63.0.2254.61942 app allows users to browse the web and search for specific addresses or websites.

TEXTFIELD_ROLE: The target textfield with the text "Search or enter address" and resource_id "url_field" is used for entering the address or URL of a website to visit.

REASONING: To fill in the textfield, I will enter a new address or URL that I want to visit. Since the textfield is used for entering new addresses, I should avoid duplicating previously entered addresses. I can generate a new address by either typing it manually or using a function that provides relevant information, such as a recently visited website or a bookmarked page.
FUNCTIONALITY: The Opera_Mini_fast_web_browser_v63.0.2254.61942 app is a fast web browser that allows users to browse the internet and search for specific addresses or websites.

TEXTFIELD_ROLE: The target textfield with the text "Search or enter address" and resource_id "url_field" is used for entering the address or URL of a website to visit.

REASONING: To fill in the textfield, I will enter a new address or URL of a website that I want to visit. Since the textfield is specifically for entering addresses, I should avoid duplicating previously entered addresses. In this case, I can generate a new address by either manually typing it or using a function that provides relevant information, such as a frequently visited website or a bookmarked page.

*** User:
Now, either provide the actual text content to fill in the textfield or call a relevant function if you need additional information for the current textfield, and there is a function that can provide the information. If you are going to immediately generate the text content, provide the text content with the prefix "TEXT_CONTENT:" in a single line, and do not include anything else in your answer except the text content. (e.g., "TEXT_CONTENT: Hello world!")

*** Assistant:
REASONING: Since the target textfield is used for entering the address or URL of a website, I will generate a new address to fill in the textfield.

TEXT_CONTENT: www.opera.com
