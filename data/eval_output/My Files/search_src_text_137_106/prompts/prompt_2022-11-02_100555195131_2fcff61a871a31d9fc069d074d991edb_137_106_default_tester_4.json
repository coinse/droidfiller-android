Consider following questions: What is the textfield for? How can I generate new text content avoiding duplication with previously generated contents? Is there any function that can provide relevant information for the textfield?>",
        "FUNCTIONALITY: The current GUI state of the My Files app displays a list of files and folders, along with various filter options and search functionalities.\n\nTEXTFIELD_ROLE: The target textfield with the text \"Search\" and resource_id \"search_src_text\" is used for entering search queries to filter the displayed files and folders.\n\nREASONING: To fill in the search textfield, I will generate a new search query that is different from the previously generated contents. Since the search textfield is used for entering search queries, I can generate a random search query based on my preferences or use a function to get a friend's profile information and use their name or any other relevant details as the search query."
