For example, you can call the function \"get_friend_profile\" to get one of your friend's profile information for filling in a contact information textfield rather than a random person's profile information.\n",

Since the app is used for buying and selling cars, I can enter a specific car model that I am interested in. To avoid duplication with previously generated contents, I can use the name of a car model that I have not searched for before. If I don't have any specific car model in mind, I can also use the \"get_samsung_product_info\" function to get the information of a Samsung product, such as a phone or a watch, and use the product name as the search query."
