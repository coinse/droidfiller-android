For example, you can call the function \"get_friend_profile\" to get one of your friend's profile information for filling in a contact information textfield rather than a random person's profile information.\n",

Since I have already used the text contents \"Landscapes\", \"Mountains\", \"Family\", and \"Nature\", I will generate a new search query using the function \"get_samsung_product_info\" to get a Samsung product type and combine it with a random adjective.\n\nHere is the text content to fill in the target textfield:\n\"Samsung <product_type> <adjective>\"\n\nNote: The <product_type> will be replaced with a random Samsung product type (e.g., phone, watch, monitor) obtained from the \"get_samsung_product_info\" function, and the <adjective> will be a randomly generated adjective."
