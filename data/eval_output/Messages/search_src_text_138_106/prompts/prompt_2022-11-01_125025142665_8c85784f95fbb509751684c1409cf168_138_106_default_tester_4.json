For example, you can call the function \"get_friend_profile\" to get one of your friend's profile information for filling in a contact information textfield rather than a random person's profile information.\n",

To do this, I will use the function \"get_friend_profile\" to retrieve the profile information of one of my friends and use their name or any other relevant information as the search query."
