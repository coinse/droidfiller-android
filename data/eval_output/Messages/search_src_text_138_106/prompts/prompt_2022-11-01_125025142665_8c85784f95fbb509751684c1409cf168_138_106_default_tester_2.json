For example, you can call the function \"get_friend_profile\" to get one of your friend's profile information for filling in a contact information textfield rather than a random person's profile information.\n",

Since I have already generated the text content \"Hello\" and \"Friends gathering plan\" before, I will generate a new keyword related to my search. I can also use the get_friend_profile function to get a friend's name or username to search for their messages or contact information."
