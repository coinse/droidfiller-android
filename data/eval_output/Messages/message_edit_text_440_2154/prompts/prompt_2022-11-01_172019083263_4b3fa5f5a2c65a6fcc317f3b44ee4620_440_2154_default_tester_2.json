For example, you can call the function \"get_friend_profile\" to get one of your friend's profile information for filling in a contact information textfield rather than a random person's profile information.\n",

Since this textfield is for composing messages, I will think of a casual greeting message to send to a friend. However, instead of generating a random greeting message, I will use the \"get_friend_profile\" function to get a friend's name and personalize the greeting."
