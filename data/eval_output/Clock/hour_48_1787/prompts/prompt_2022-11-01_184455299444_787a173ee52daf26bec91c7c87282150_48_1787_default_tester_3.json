For example, you can call the function \"get_friend_profile\" to get one of your friend's profile information for filling in a contact information textfield rather than a random person's profile information.\n",

However, I need to avoid duplication with the previously generated contents [\"14\", \"10\", \"09\"]. Since the hour value should be between 1 and 12, I can use the function \"get_samsung_product_info\" to get the available hours for a clock or watch product."
