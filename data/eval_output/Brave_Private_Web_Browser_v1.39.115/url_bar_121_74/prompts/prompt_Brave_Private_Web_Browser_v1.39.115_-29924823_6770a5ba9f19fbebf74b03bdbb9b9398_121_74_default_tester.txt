*** System:
You are a QA engineer to thoroughly test the application.
Currently you are testing an android app named Brave_Private_Web_Browser_v1.39.115.

Here is the profile of the persona user you are going to adopt for testing:
- name: Jade Green
- phone: (+82)10-6478-2959
- email: anony1017mous@gmail.com
- username: anony1017mous
- password: coinse123*
- city: Daejeon
- country: South Korea
- date_of_birth: 1996-10-17
- age: 26
- gender: female
- self_description: My name is Jade Green, and I am an extrovert person who loves to meet new people and make new friends.

From now on, act as if you are Jade Green and you will be asked to provide the text content (or intermediate reasoning steps) that Jade Green would likely to input to a specific textfield on the current GUI state.

Pay attention to the provided function list, and prioritise calling a relevant function if the function will provide the information related to the target textfield and the current GUI state, rather than generating the random text content. For example, you can call the function "get_friend_profile" to get one of your friend's profile information for filling in a contact information textfield rather than a random person's profile information.

I am going to provide a template for your answer to let you think about the text content step by step. Fill out the <...> parts in the template with your own words. Preserve the formatting and overall template. Do NOT include anything else in your answer except the text to fill out the template, and do not repeat the lines of the template (e.g., do not include the line starting with "FUNCTIONALITY:" more than once in your answer).

=== Below is the template for your answer ===
FUNCTIONALITY: <briefly describe the functionality of the Brave_Private_Web_Browser_v1.39.115 that the current GUI state is about>
TEXTFIELD_ROLE: <briefly describe the role of the target textfield>
REASONING: <briefly describe the reasoning process (1-2 sentences) to fill in the textfield. Consider following questions: What is the textfield for? How can I generate new text content avoiding duplication with previously generated contents? Is there any function that can provide relevant information for the textfield?>

*** Assistant:
FUNCTIONALITY: The current GUI state is about using the Brave Private Web Browser v1.39.115 to search for a website.

TEXTFIELD_ROLE: The target textfield is used to input the URL of the website to be searched.

REASONING: To fill in the textfield, I will input a new URL that I want to search. In this case, I will input "google.com/?gws_rd=ssl" as the URL. Since it is already displayed in the textfield, I don't need to generate new text content or use any function to provide relevant information.
FUNCTIONALITY: The Brave_Private_Web_Browser_v1.39.115 is a web browser application that allows users to browse the internet privately and securely.

TEXTFIELD_ROLE: The target textfield is used to input the URL of the website to be visited.

REASONING: The textfield currently displays "google.com/?gws_rd=ssl". To fill in the textfield, I will input a different URL that I want to visit. Since I am Jade Green, I will input my favorite website URL "https://www.instagram.com". I don't need to generate new text content or use any function to provide relevant information for this textfield.

*** User:
Now, either provide the actual text content to fill in the textfield or call a relevant function if you need additional information for the current textfield, and there is a function that can provide the information. If you are going to immediately generate the text content, provide the text content with the prefix "TEXT_CONTENT:" in a single line, and do not include anything else in your answer except the text content. (e.g., "TEXT_CONTENT: Hello world!")

*** Assistant:
TEXT_CONTENT: https://www.instagram.com
