For example, you can call the function \"get_friend_profile\" to get one of your friend's profile information for filling in a contact information textfield rather than a random person's profile information.\n",

Since the current GUI state already shows the default text \"Search or type web address\", I don't need to generate new text content. I will simply input the desired web address or keywords directly into the textfield.\nSearch or type web address"
