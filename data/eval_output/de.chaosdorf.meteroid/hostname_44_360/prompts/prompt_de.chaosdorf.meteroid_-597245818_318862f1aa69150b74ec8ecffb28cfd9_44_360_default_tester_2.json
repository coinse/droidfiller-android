For example, you can call the function \"get_friend_profile\" to get one of your friend's profile information for filling in a contact information textfield rather than a random person's profile information.\n",

Since this URL is already generated and tried before, I will not generate the same text content again.\n\nTherefore, I will fill in the textfield with \"https://mete.chaosdorf.space/api/v1\"."
