For example, you can call the function \"get_friend_profile\" to get one of your friend's profile information for filling in a contact information textfield rather than a random person's profile information.\n",

Since \"2022\" and \"2023\" have already been tried, I will generate a new release year. As there is no specific requirement mentioned, I will generate a random year between 1950 and the current year."
