For example, you can call the function \"get_friend_profile\" to get one of your friend's profile information for filling in a contact information textfield rather than a random person's profile information.\n",

Since the target textfield is for specifying the track number of a song, I can use the current position of the song in the playlist as the track number. I will check if there is a function available to get the current position of the song in the playlist."
