For example, you can call the function \"get_friend_profile\" to get one of your friend's profile information for filling in a contact information textfield rather than a random person's profile information.\n",

I will avoid duplication with previously generated contents by checking the list of generated text contents. Since the textfield is for entering the name of the store, I can use the function \"get_friend_profile\" to get the name of one of my friends' stores."
