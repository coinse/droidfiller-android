For example, you can call the function \"get_friend_profile\" to get one of your friend's profile information for filling in a contact information textfield rather than a random person's profile information.\n",

Since I have already generated \"Odyssey G7\" and \"LC27G55TQWNXZA\" as text contents, I will use the function \"get_samsung_product_info\" to get the model name of a Samsung monitor.\n\nCODE:\n```typescript\nfunctions.get_samsung_product_info({ product_type: \"monitor\" })\n```\n\nEXPECTED RESULT: The function will provide me with the model name of a Samsung monitor, which I can use to fill in the textfield."
