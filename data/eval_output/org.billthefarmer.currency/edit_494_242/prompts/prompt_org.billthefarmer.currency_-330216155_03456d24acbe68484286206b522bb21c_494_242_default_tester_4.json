        "FUNCTIONALITY: The org.billthefarmer.currency app allows the user to convert currencies and view the exchange rates.\n\nTEXTFIELD_ROLE: The target textfield is used to input a currency value for conversion.\n\nREASONING: The target textfield requires a currency value to be entered. Since the current value is \"1.000\" and we have already generated [\"2.500\", \"852.000\", \"3.142\", \"0.001\"], we can generate a new value that is different from the previous ones. To do this, we can use a random number generator to generate a value between 0.001 and 10.000."
