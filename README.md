# droidfiller-artifact

This repository contains artifacts for the paper titled "Integrating LLM-based Text Generation with Dynamic Context Retrieval for GUI Testing". Note that the GUI testing tool, STEM (Scenario-learnt Test Execution Model), and the LLM-based text input generation technique, DroidFiller, remain proprietary. This repository contains some inforamtion that could not fit the paper due to the page limit (fot example, the list of apps that are studied). It also contains scripts used to analyse the empirical evaluation results.
